random_face_color
by Phil Cote

A just-fun-fun script that generates random colors and applies it on every color of a selected mesh.

HOW TO USE: 
-  Hit t in the 3D view to bring up your toolbar.
-  Select a mesh with a reasonable number of faces.
- Set your minimum and maximum color intensity.
- Set whether or not you want gray scale of full color.
-  Push the "Random Face Materials" button.

Remember to click the "Remove Unused Randoms" after you're done playing.
Otherwise you get a mess of 'randmat' materials left behind in your project.

CAUTION: Do not use this on a mesh or meshes that amount to a large number of faces.
You will probably crash Blender if you do.
