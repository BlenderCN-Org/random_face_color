random_face_color
by Phil Cote

A just-fun-fun script that generates random colors and applies it on every color of a selected mesh.

HOW TO USE: 
-  Hit t in the 3D view to bring up your toolbar.
-  Select a mesh with a reasonable number of faces.
-  Push the "Random Face Materials" button.

WARNING: Be careful playing with this as you can cause a lot of unused materials to build up on the project.
There's a button for "Remove Unused Materials" that I added so you can clear out the materials you generated
after you're done playing with this script.
